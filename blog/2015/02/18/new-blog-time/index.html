<p>I&rsquo;ve bitten the bullet and created a technical blog.  This will be the
blog where I discuss technical issues.  A lot of interesting technical
problems come up via my work at <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org">Khan
Academy</a>, and this is where I&rsquo;ll share them.</p>

<p>And now I will say the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; a few more times.
Technical technical technical technical.</p>

<p>Technical.</p>
